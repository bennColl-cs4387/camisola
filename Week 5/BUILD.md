# Building p5.js Web Editor from Source
## Build Process
Following the [p5.js Contributor guidelines](https://p5js.org/contribute/contributor_guidelines/#quick-get-started-for-developers) and [Development Installation instructions](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/blob/develop/contributor_docs/installation.md), I was able to build the p5.js Web Editor from source â€” albeit with some limited functionalities. The first steps of installing Node.js, forking the p5.js Web Editor repository, and cloning [my fork](https://github.com/callybton/p5.js-web-editor) into my local computer were straightforward. Some issues began to arise in installing all the dependencies with `npm install`.

The *Development Installation* instructions only required Node.js version 16.14.2, so I simply proceeded. (As I'm focusing on the fundamental build, I decided to revisit addressing vulnerabilities in the future.) Afterward, I used `npm start` to successfully run the p5.js Web Editor on a local server.

## Changed Code
After building the p5.js Web Editor from source, I tested out implementing basic modifications to the code. I looked through my cloned repository and found the stylesheets. In *client/styles/components/_editor.scss*, I changed the text editor's background color to verify if my changes would appear once I refreshed my browser: this proved successful.
