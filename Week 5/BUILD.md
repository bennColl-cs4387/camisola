# Building p5.js Web Editor from Source
## Build Process
Following the [p5.js Contributor guidelines](https://p5js.org/contribute/contributor_guidelines/#quick-get-started-for-developers) and [Development Installation instructions](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/blob/develop/contributor_docs/installation.md), I was able to build the p5.js Web Editor environment â€” albeit with limited functionalities. The first steps of installing Node.js, forking the p5.js Web Editor repository, and cloning my fork into my local computer were straightforward. Some issues began to arise in installing all the dependencies with `npm install`.

The *Development Installation* instructions only required Node.js version 16.14.2, so I simply proceeded. As I wanted to focus on the fundamental build, I decided to revisit practices for addressing vulnerabilities in the future. Afterward, I was able to successfully run the build on a local server with `npm start.`
