# Cally Amisola's Repository for Open Source Software in Practice (CS4387)
## 👩🏻‍💻 Biography
Welcome to my repo! I'm Cally Amisola, a Senior at Bennington College (as of the Fall 2024 semester) studying Computer Science, Design, and New Media. I took this course to acquire more coding experience and — for the first time — engage in open-source communties, practices, and contributions. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cally-amisola/) or [my website](callypso.design).

## 👤 List of Solo Fixes
From Week 10 onwards, I began working on some fixes independently.
- _p5.JS Web Editor_'s Issue with Illegible Text on Dark/High Contrast Mode
- _Kestra_'s Issue with Unnecessary Background Behind Text

## 👥 Group Fix
From Weeks 7-9, Nath Freires and I worked collaboratively on _p5.JS Website_ [Issue 516](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/issues/516) concerning the layout responsiveness, wherein certain text and/or classes are cut off when the website is viewed on screens with smaller width. Nath and I's code for this fix can be found in our shared [forked repository](https://github.com/callybton/p5.js-website), which is described in our [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/197LLvZXauJRpocG0KSUylJNpRxrUTCShBL1Q2TjmeAY/edit?tab=t.0). Doing this Group Fix not only gave me my first insights into building from source and reading & understanding other people's codebase, but also on how collaborative programming enables faster debugging and exploring multiple versatile solutions.

## 📝 Essay
In weeks 6-7, I began planning more thoroughly for my first (individual) fix and detailed it all in a proposal essay.
