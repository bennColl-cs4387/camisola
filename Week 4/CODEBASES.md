# First Open-Source Contributions and Fixes
I am looking into different _JavaScript_- and _Python_-based repositories that have beginner-friendly open issues for my first open-source contribution. I am especially interested in working on libraries and projects that I already use, or are similar to them.

## Resources
Different repositories and websites were helpful resources in looking at potential first fixes. I am continuing to look through the codebases and/or issues listed there.

## Potential Codebases
As of Week 4, I am exploring two different options in particular.

**1. [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js)**:
p5.js is a Javascript library for creating interactive visuals with code in the web browser. It has a highly active user and contributor community alongside expansive documentation with visual examples. The project is divided into three general repositories: *p5.js*, the *p5.js* website, and the *p5.js* Web Editor.

**2. [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh)**:
Bokeh is an interactive visualization Python library for modern web browsers. It has a Bokeh Discourse community and options to contribute through the Python codebase, BokehJS, or in improving documentation.
